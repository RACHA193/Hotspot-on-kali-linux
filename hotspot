---Setting Up Hotspot On kali Linux Machine (root user)---



> lspci   (to check the drivers on your device) (if you use usb wireless adapter type command lsusb)
Now we need to install 2 additional tools to make out hotspot, 1st one is hostapd(hotspot server), 2nd one is dnsmasq(dns dhcp server).
> apt-get install hostapd 
> apt-get install dnsmasq
Stop those services if started already, and prevent them from starting on system start up.
> service hostapd stop
> service dnsmasq stop
> update-rc.d hostapd disable
> update-rc.d dnsmasq disable
Now we need to set up config files
> gedit /etc/dnsmasq.conf
Add below lines to the config file:
------------------------------------------------
# Bind to only one interface
bind-interfaces
# Choose interface for binding
interface=wlan0
# Specify range of IP addresses for DHCP leasses
dhcp-range=192.168.150.2,192.168.150.10
------------------------------------------------
> gedit /etc/hostapd.conf
Add below lines to config file:
------------------------------------------------------------
# Define interface
interface=wlan0
# Select driver
driver=nl80211
# Set access point name
ssid=myhotspot
# Set access point harware mode to 802.11g
hw_mode=g
# Set WIFI channel (can be easily changed)
channel=6
# Enable WPA2 only (1 for WPA, 2 for WPA2, 3 for WPA + WPA2)
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=mypassword
------------------------------------------------------------
You can change ssid name and password for anything you want here. Current config will create hotspot named myhotspot with password mypassword.
Open a text editor and add below code and save it as "hotspot.sh" on your desktop.
----------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
# Start
# Configure IP address for WLAN
sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.150.1
# Start DHCP/DNS server
sudo service dnsmasq restart
# Enable routing
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
# Enable NAT
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE
# Run access point daemon
sudo hostapd /etc/hostapd.conf
# Stop
# Disable NAT
sudo iptables -D POSTROUTING -t nat -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE
# Disable routing
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
# Disable DHCP/DNS server
sudo service dnsmasq stop
sudo service hostapd stop
----------------------------------------------------------
You will probably need to change ppp0 in this to eth0 or any other netwwork interface which refers to your wired connection.
> cd /root/Desktop/
> ./hotspot.sh
OUTPUT:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED

ERRORS I FACED:


1. 

nl80211:Could not configure driver mode

Fix.
Opened sub-terminal
> airmon-ng check
2 processes are running: NetworkManager & wpa_supplicant
> pkill wpa_supplicant (as it interfears with hotspot interface)
> airmon-ng check (only NetworkManager process is running)
Main termianl
> ./hotspot.sh (error 2)


2.

net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 Line 13: 
invalid WPA passphrase length 5 (expected 8..63) 
WPA-PSK enabled, but PSK or passphrase is not configured. 
2 errors found in configuration file '/etc/hostapd.conf' 
Failed to set up interface with /etc/hostapd.conf 
Failed to initialize interface net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

Fix.
Opened config file and changed password from 5 characters length to strong 9 characters.


3.

nl80211:kernel reports:key not allowed
Failed to set beacon parameters

Fix.
Tried downgrading hostapd (didn't worked)
> nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (Found this fix in a blog to persist the fix through reboots)
Add the following code in NetworkManager.conf file:
---------------------------------------
unmanaged-devices=mac:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
---------------------------------------
x's are replaced by your wifi mac-address. Saved and restarted (didn't wworked)
Read several blogs and tried few fixes (didn't worked)
Sub-terminal
> airmon-ng check (found out wpa_supplicant is still running)
> pkill wpa_supplicant
Main terminal
> ./hotspot.sh (still error)
subterminal 
> airmon-ng check (still wpa_supplicant is running)
> pkill wpa_supplicant
> service wpa_supplicant status (it is disabled but still actively running in the background. It is active - maybe systemd bug)
Killed the process and restarted the system, problem is still on.
Need to stop wpa_supplicant 
> systemctl mask wpa_supplicant.service (disallows all and any attempts to start the wpa_supplicant. When masking a service, the symlinks are moved and 
then point to /dev/null.)
> airmon-ng check (wpa_supplicant is stopped, if not pkill it and check again)
> ./hotspot.sh (finally worked, connected to my phone)

hostapd (hostapd is a user space daemon software enabling a network interface card to act as an access point and authentication server.)

dnsmasq (dnsmasq is a lightweight and simple program which enables issuing DHCP addresses on your network and registering the hostname & IP address in DNS.)

daemon (a program that runs continuously as a background process and wakes up to handle periodic service requests, which often come from remote processes.)

systemd (systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux operating systems. The main aim is to unify service configuration
and behavior across Linux distributions. Its primary component is a "system and service manager" â€“ an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage 
user processes.)

systemctl (The systemctl command manages both system and service configurations, enabling administrators to manage the OS and control the status of services.)

symlinks (Symbolic links (also called "soft" links) are files that point to a file or directory in your system, but don't mirror the other file's data.)
